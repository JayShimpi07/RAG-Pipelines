 Machine Learning with Python
    Python has become the go-to language for machine learning due to its simplicity and the availability of
    powerful libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. These libraries provide tools for building and training machine learning models, making it easier for developers to implement complex algorithms.

        Key Libraries:
        - TensorFlow: An open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning.
        - Keras: A high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow.
        - Scikit-learn: A library for simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
        Applications:
        - Image and speech recognition
        - Natural language processing
        - Predictive analytics
        - Recommender systems
        Python's role in machine learning continues to grow, with ongoing advancements in libraries and frameworks that enhance its capabilities in this field.
